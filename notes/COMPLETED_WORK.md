# Completed Work Archive

This document archives completed work items from cogpack development. For current development status, see [../CLAUDE.cogpack.md](../CLAUDE.cogpack.md).

## Core System Implementation (2025-07-15 to 2025-07-17)

### Foundation
- **Composer API with phase organization**: Clean API for building plans with logical phase grouping
- **Python stack with basic blocks**: Uv, CogWheel, Python blocks implemented
- **Mount-based context system**: fs.FS mounts for flexible file access
- **BuildKit integration with LLB translation**: Plan execution via BuildKit
- **Input resolution**: Auto, phase, and stage references

### CLI Integration
- **MVP `cog plan` command**: Outputs plan metadata and normalized plan as JSON
- **Operation input resolution**: Copy, Add, and Mount operations support phase references

### Phase System
- **Phase pre-registration**: All standard phases registered at composer creation
- **UV block cross-phase references**: UV block copies venv using `PhaseBuildComplete` reference
- **Single Phase List Architecture**: Unified build/export phases, eliminated artificial boundaries

## Environment & Runtime (2025-07-16 to 2025-07-18)

### Environment Variable Handling
- **Environment Variable Inheritance**: Complete solution for preserving ENV/PATH from base images through BuildKit LLB translation
- **Image Config Metadata Flow**: Image config inspection during Plan → LLB translation
- **Critical Environment Variable Preservation Fix**: Fixed bug where `llb.Diff()` operations lost environment variables

### Python Runtime
- **Wheel Installation Fix**: Resolved UV pip install wildcard issue with explicit wheel filename resolution
- **UV Python Dependency Installation**: Two-phase installation (framework vs user packages), intelligent package classification
- **UV Block UV-Native Architecture**: Treat all Python projects as UV projects, convert legacy via pyproject.toml

## Source Code & Build Process (2025-07-17)

### Source Handling
- **Source Copy Functionality**: SourceCopyBlock implementation with proper BuildKit Copy semantics
- **Source Copy with Directory Removal**: `rm -rf /venv` before copy to prevent nesting

### Build Optimization
- **Working Directory vs Shell Commands**: Use LLB working directory instead of shell cd commands

## Testing Infrastructure (2025-07-17 to 2025-07-18)

### Unit Testing
- **Comprehensive Unit Tests for UV Block**: 6 focused tests (BasicDetection, VenvCreation, DependencyInstallation variants, VenvCopyToRuntime)

### Integration Testing
- **Complete Integration Test Framework**: Testcontainers-based verification with fixtures
- **Docker Test Environment Package**: Unified `dockertestenv` package for testing infrastructure
- **Enhanced Plan->LLB Translation Testing**: Comprehensive framework to catch environment variable issues

### Test Infrastructure
- **buildImageFromFixture() helper**: Building cogpack images from test fixtures
- **Testcontainers integration**: Proper Docker client selection (`COGPACK=1`)
- **Test fixtures with documentation**: `minimal-source`, `minimal-dependencies`, `minimal-debug`
- **Environment variable propagation testing**: Direct BuildKit plan execution verification

## Major Refactoring (2025-07-18)

### UV Block Improvements
- **UV Block Simplification**: Major refactoring to implement UV-native approach
- **Critical Bug Fix**: Environment variable inheritance in BuildKit LLB translation
- **Dynamic requirements.txt generation**: For legacy projects converted to UV
- **UV optimization flags**: CFLAGS, UV_TORCH_BACKEND support
- **PyTorch index URL handling**: Proper package source configuration

## System Integration

### Docker Integration
- **DockerTestEnv struct**: Managing DIND + optional registry lifecycle
- **Parallel-safe execution**: Complete container isolation for tests
- **Registry integration**: With existing `registry_testhelpers`

### Plan System
- **Plan composition**: Composer.Compose() → Plan workflow
- **Plan normalization**: Immutable plan execution
- **Metadata flow**: Complete metadata accumulation through build stages
